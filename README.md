**IEMod<sub>pw</sub> Version/Patchwork Version:** 0.7/0.5

*Also stylized **IEMod.pw** in places that don't support subscripts*.

This is a **fork** of [IEMod](https://bitbucket.org/Bester/poe-modding-framework) mod for [Pillars of Eternity](http://eternity.obsidian.net/). I ported the mod to my new assembly modification framework, [Patchwork](https://github.com/GregRos/Patchwork). Originally I hoped to merge my fork into the original mod, but I couldn't contact any active developers, so I decided to continue development by myself for now.

I've transferred this project from [my old Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/GregRoss/patchwork-iemod).

I'll introduce IEMod myself at some point, but for now I'll just let the original website do the talking:

* [IEMod Nexus Page](http://www.nexusmods.com/pillarsofeternity/mods/1/?)
* [IEMod Website](http://rien-ici.com/iemod/)

My only modifications so far have been mostly to the implementation, and I've kept the user-visible parts completely unchanged, except for one small addition.

I've focused on making further modding both convenient and expedient, so I've mainly only worked on parts that every modder would want to use: the code injection features (implemented in Patchwork) and the UI creation.

I don't plan and I don't recommend modifying any other parts without good reason, as that code is really complicated, and changing it is error prone.

The main reason I did all this work was to make modding easier. While I am going to contribute to it myself, I'd also welcome any contributions of yours, or even if you want to get permissions so you can work on the repo yourself.

## New Additions
These are additional mods to the game, beyond the functionality of the original IEMod.

### Target Turned Enemies
I've added an option called *"target turned enemies"* that makes enemies that have switched allegiance due to e.g. dominate, confusion, etc. to be considered hostile against your attacks. I always hated how being a little confused gave your enemies miraculous defensive benefits.

## Code Injection
See the [Patchwork library](https://github.com/GregRos/Patchwork) for more information. Patchwork is made part of this repository as a sub-module (basically a kind of sub-project).

## UI Creation
The options/settings of the mod are handled in the folder `IEMod\Mods\Options`.

Previously, UI creation was pretty convoluted and involved *a lot* of repetition. It also involved working around rather inconvenient (for us) features, such as language-specific string tables, and a pretty confusing GameObject and Component hierarchy. 

Of course, some of that still happens, but somewhere far away from you.

The new setup uses the *static* class `IEModOptions` for your options. Each option is just a field (it could also be a property). Add the `[Label]` attribute to the member to set the label of the control that option is bound to, and `[Description]` to set its tooltip.

These options can be bound to controls created using the class `IEControlFactory`. Currently, the class can only create checkboxes bound to boolean fields/properties, and combo boxes bound to enum-typed fields/properties (each enum value represents an option).

You can put the `[Description]` attribute on each value in the enum definition to set its label in the combo box. 

Before creating a control, you have to get an example of that control from the UI. It's used as a prototype. Then you need the `Example` property for that control in the control factory. 

The UI is created in the file `mod_UIOptionsManager`. Here is an example of how simple the process is:

		//this is how you create a control factory:
		var controlFactory = new IEControlFactory {
			ExampleCheckbox = exampleCheckbox.gameObject,
			CurrentParent = Pages[5],
			ExampleComboBox = exampleDropdown.gameObject
		};
		//now you can just create the controls and they are automatically added to the page:
		//one check box
		_blueCirclesBg = controlFactory.Checkbox(() => IEModOptions.BlueCirclesBG);
		_blueCirclesBg.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(-180, 240, 0);

		//another checkbox
		_alwaysShowCircles = controlFactory.Checkbox(() => IEModOptions.AlwaysShowCircles);
		_alwaysShowCircles.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(-210, 210, 0);

		//this is a dropdown:
		_nerfedXpCmb = controlFactory.EnumBoundDropdown(() => IEModOptions.NerfedXPTableSetting, 515, 300);
		_nerfedXpCmb.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(-80, -70, 0);
		
The methods for creating controls take an `Expression` parameter. An expression is a bit like a lambda, but you can freely inspect it, so I just pull the  property/field you want to bind to the control from the lambda you write there. It's extremely convenient.

By the way, binding means that once the control is changed, the property/field is changed as well. Unfortunately, it doesn't work the other way around, at least not at this point.

## Debugging Tips
Debugging mods like this one is hard. It's possible to debug Unity applications (attach a debugger to them, I mean), it's possible to debug modified assemblies, and it's possible to debug assemblies you don't have any debug symbols for. Unfortunately, there is no tool that allows you to debug all three, and I have no idea how to make one.

If you were writing against framework version 4.5, you could at least use the `CallerMemberName`, `CallerLineNumber`, etc, attributes, so you can keep track of where the program failed. Unfortunately, the game is built against 3.5, and it doesn't work properly when you compile the patch against 4.5 instead.

Debugging involves printouts and using the logs. The game's default debug log is in `PillarsOfEternity_Data\output_log.txt`. Crash reports, which include additional data like memory dumps, are filed in the main folder. The game only crashed when something really nasty happens, and most exceptions (including things like `NullReferenceException` and even `InvalidProgramException`) are just logged, and the show goes on. Usually, things like weird graphical glitches, disappearing text, and so on, indicate that an exception has been thrown.

In addition to this, you can use `IEDebug.Log` to write to a special log dedicated for `IEMod` that this class creates. It appears in the main folder of the game. This method also writes to the standard debug log.

Because debugging is so difficult, your best bet is to check things carefully. Check if things are `null`, if an expression is a valid type before casting, etc, and then throw an exception that tells you something about the problem. Handling exceptions, if only to rethrow more meaningful ones, is also a good idea. Assertions are also great.

It's best to throw `IEModException`, because you'll be able to find the exception in the log later, and it narrows down the place where it was thrown. Also, `IEDebug.Exception` creates a new `IEModException` and also logs it to the IE mod log, which is handy.
